# Generalities
Go is a **general-purpose language** designed with systems programming in mind. It is **strongly typed** with a **garbage collector** and has support for **concurrent programming**. Programs are built from `packages`, whose properties allow for efficient management of dependencies.

The syntax is compact and easy to parse, enabling straightforward analysis through automated tools like the integrated development environment.
